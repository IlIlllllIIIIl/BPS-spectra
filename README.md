<!-- Given a positive integer $m$, consider when it can be decomposed into product of coprime integers, an irreducible subrepresentation of the metaplectic double cover $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ on a rank one latticeonce can be obtained once certain subgroup of $Ex_m$, the group of exact divisors, is specified. -->

We have generated data for $m$'s that can be decomposed into product of two and three corprime integers. When $m=p_1p_2p_3$, basis of the representation labeled by $K=\{1,p_1p_2,p_2p_3,p_3p_1\}$ can be decomposed into linear combination of (false-)theta functions, and the projection information is saved `data/seifert/projections`, where `.json` files are titled by the three coprime integers. When $m=p_1p_2$, there will be two different subrepresentations labeled by $K=\{1,p_1\}$ and $K=\{1,p_2\}$, whose projections are saved respectively under the same directory.

A notebook WILL be provided to read these data.
